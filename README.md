# ðŸ§  Agent Storm: AI Brainstorming System  

Agent Storm is an **AI multi-agent system** that allows one to have brainstorming sessions with a team of AI experts. This agentic system will generate multiple personas (LLM instances with specific personalities) depending on the topic you want to discuss. It will then coordinate the discussion between you and these autonomous personas to refine ideas collaboratively.  

**Human-in-the-loop** support: The system enables human intervention at key stages (persona approval, discussion turns), the graph pauses and waits for user feedback. 

#### Tools & Technologies:
**LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **OpenAI API**, with a lightweight **Streamlit web interface** for human interaction.

## ðŸš€ Architecture  

The system is built with **LangGraph** to orchestrate different agents:  

- **PersonaFactoryAgent** â†’ generates initial candidate personas for the brainstorming session.  
- **PersonaAgent** â†’ personas that research, form opinions, and contribute to the discussion.  
- **BrainstormAgent (Coordinator)** â†’ moderates the discussion, compresses history, and produces a final summary.   

#### High-Level Workflow Diagram

![Architecture Diagram](docs/agent_storm_graph.png)  

#### Execution flow:
1. **Persona Generation** â†’ LLM proposes a set of personas.  
2. **Human Feedback** â†’ user reviews and refines the personas.  
3. **Discussion Loop** â†’ personas debate, user may interject.  
4. **Final Summary** â†’ coordinator produces meeting notes.

**P.S:** since there is only one persona that can talk at a time we don't need to duplicate the persona agent *n* times in our graph. A smarter approach would be to have one agent representing the active persona at a given time.

Below is the architecture diagram of the persona factory agent and the active persona agent.

The **persona factory agent** will generate an initial group of personas based on the topic you propose for discussion. The user can then give their feedback, asking for modifications if they want. After that these personas are fixed for the entire session.

The **persona agent** is equiped with the ability to do web search in order to obtain up-to-date information about the ideas being discussed. After retrieving the relevant context information an LLM is used to generate its opinion or answer any questions directed to it.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation  

Clone the repo and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-dorgham/agent-storm.git
cd agent-storming
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## âš¡ Usage  

### Run the web interface  

The project comes with a **Streamlit UI** (`app.py`) for easy testing:  

```bash
streamlit run agent_storming/app.py
```
This launches a simple web app where you can:

- Enter a **topic** and the number of personas to generate.
- Provide **feedback** on the generated personas.
- Participate in the **discussion loop** until typing end.
- View the **final summary** of the brainstorming session.

## ðŸ”‘ API Keys  

Make sure to set up the following environment variables in your shell before running:  

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key_here
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
*(You can also use a `.env` file with `python-dotenv` if you prefer.)*
